// Note: Had to use fopen_s using three arguments for opening the file because Visual Studio has issues using fopen

int main() {
    // Complete this part: Declare a file pointer
    FILE* file;

    // Declare a string to store user input
    char data[100];
    // Ask the user to input data
    printf("Enter some text to write to a file: ");
    fgets(data, sizeof(data), stdin);  // Read user input with spaces
    
    // Open the file in write mode ("w")
    // Complete this part: create a new file if it doesn't exist or overwrite if it does: 
    // use this inside fopen "output.txt", "w" and assign the fopen to file pointer
    errno_t err = fopen_s(&file, "output.txt", "w");
    
    // Complete this part: Check if the file was opened successfully using if statement to check if file pointer is null
    if (err != 0) {
        printf("Error opening file.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // Complete this part: Write the user input to the file: use the file pointer, with "%s" and data in fprintf
    fprintf(file, "%s", data);
    
    // Close the file after writing
    fclose(file);
    
    // Inform the user that the data has been written
    printf("Data has been written to 'output.txt'.\n");
